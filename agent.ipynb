    "This notebook is a proof of concept for the ViraLens Agent. The agent is supposed to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search the web for the latest news on AI using the Tavily API\n",
    "- Then it will select the news that has the most potential to create the most viral tiktok\n",
    "- After this, it will do some more research about the news using tavily again. \n",
    "- Once it is done with the above, it will generate a script with a hook and everything such that it can be used to create a tiktok video. "
